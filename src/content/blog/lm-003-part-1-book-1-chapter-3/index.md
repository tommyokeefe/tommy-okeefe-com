The size of Myriel's bishopric was substantial. Rather than using his charity as an excuse for staying put in Digne proper, he was regularly traveling to visit all of the curacies, vicarages, and chapels-of-ease - a total of more than 350 separate places of worship. Additionally we get this beautiful picture of the kind of work he was actually doing. Rather than setting himself apart he made himself available and he tailored his communication to the group he was visiting. Rather than preaching, most of his attention went to on the ground talking and helping, working with the people in his care toward the common good of all. The picture we get is the inverse of what some of the church likely looked like at this time. Myriel actually embodied the love and teaching of Christ. He was a saint in the truest sense of the word.
