It's been quite a month and I'm thankful for the music that helped make it a little more tolerable. Below you'll find my thoughts on some new music and some other music that was new to me. I've linked to a playlist that pulls together some highlights from my month in music with a vague theme of resistance that finds it's center in love. Here's the top 25 albums that filled my ears this month. Check out the playlist at the bottom to hit some highlights!

## New Music

There's a quite a bit of great music that came out this month, but there are two albums I came back to quite a bit. 

### "Shaking Hand" by Shaking Hand

These kids from Manchester are so good! This album has been basically on repeat since it dropped. I love the meditative quality of some of the repetitive riffs. It reminds me a lot of the early emo / post-hardcore from the 90s that I loved so much, bands like Unwound and Karate. The wrinkle here is that a lot of the melodic sensibilities and vocal approach feel like they came from college radio around the same time. It's fresh and nostalgic. The kids are gonna be alright!

### "DREAMCRUSH" by MØL

I've been listening to MØL for the past five years or so and have come to really love their particular brand of blackgaze. This latest album is their best work yet in my opinion, and starts to blur the lines between those blackgaze roots and the "dream metal" of bands like Astronoid. it reminds me of the similar growth we've seen from Lantlôs, who has a new record dropping later this year. The melodic bits are delightful, the blast beats deliver, and the album as a whole is greater than the sum of it's parts.

## New To Me Music

These two albums are not technically "new" as they both came out last fall, but they are new to me and I have been listening to them over and over the last couple of weeks. 

### "Les déferlantes" by NAUFRAAGE

Blackened Skramz out of France. This album is an absolute monster. The riffs are gigantic and there is a lot of beauty and pain in the mix here. I'm a sucker for all of the ingredients that go into this album and this particular mix is potent and powerful. 11/10, would highly recommend.

### "Sila Nuna" by Sedna

Post Black Metal from Italy that bends, winds and morphs it's way through a sludgy mix of metal genres. From punishing riffs to gorgeous ambient passages, this album covers some serious territory. I found out in [this review](https://www.nocleansinging.com/2025/11/19/an-ncs-album-premiere-and-a-review-sedna-sila-nuna/) that the album pulls heavily from Inuit mythology. The title "Sila Nuna" is Inuktitut for "Sky and Earth" and the album seems to cover both and everything between. I can't get enough of this!

## Playlist Links

With everything going on in our country I keep thinking about how resistance is only sustainable if it is rooted in love. As I pulled songs together I realized that the composite vibe (for me at least) reinforced that sense of community and love in the face of a bleak and dark brand of fascism that seems to have rapidly taken root here.
