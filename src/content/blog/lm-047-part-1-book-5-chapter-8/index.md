As our chapter begins we see people in the warehouse watching Fantine and her habits. Writing letters twice a month, and doing it with great consistency, caused the other workers to start whispering. We're told some of it was jealousy of Fantine's beauty, while another portion was just the need to gossip. Either way, people were actively trying to uncover the truth of her story. With time they noted that she was often crying about something, They also found the address where the letters were being sent. After getting the letter writer drunk one of the towns-women was able to extract the information that Fantine had a child, and so with that they decided they knew what type of woman she was. 

Shortly after this one particular busybody made the trip to the Thenardiers house and with some coin was able to prove that the child was real and Fantine was really her mother. Using the occasion as leverage, the Thenardiers increased the rate they charged Fantine to 15 Francs and at the same time, this busybody spread the word around about Fantine and in the end, Fantine was let go from her warehouse job. 

Here we see her at a new low spot. She can't leave because she owes on the house she is staying in, but now she has no job and no prospects. 

I don't have much to say about this beyond the summary. The simple matter is that Fantine's life was made harder when what she needed was a hand up. This is the pattern we are seeing Hugo unfold again and again, and it's a familiar one. Those who suffer most are often the ones who have the hardest time getting help. Those who don't need help could find it anywhere.
