As is becoming a pattern with Hugo's approach in this novel, this last chapter in the current "book" is long and climactic, providing both insight into and resolution for particular characters. In this chapter, the characters of note who come together are Javert, Fantine, and Madeleine. 

Let's begin with Javert. As he hears Fantine lay out her case detailing what had happened and why she should be shown mercy, it is clear that nothing she says - no matter how damning toward the instigator Bamatabois it may be - is going to sway his opinion. At it's core, he sees this as a cut and dry case. Fantine, someone decidedly _outside_ of society has attacked Bamatabois, someone he sees as soundly _inside_ society, and that makes this the exact kind of crime Javert has built not only his career but his identity around. To him, this will always be a situation where those inside must be protected from the outside regardless of detail. This kind of justice is a huge part of why systems like the one Hugo has gone to great pains to describe are able to continue with their destruction of the oppressed and profit and security of the oppressors. 

Now turning to Fantine. She hears Javert sentence her and she continues to plead for mercy. She initially spits in the face of Madeleine, the one who will actually demand mercy for her, and continues to see him as the actual problem. She pleads with Javert expecting that his form of justice seeks to rectify wrongs on behalf of all people equally, failing to recognize that his vision of justice will always put her on the outside and always protect the likes of Bamatabois. She is completely unprepared for the grace and mercy she is about to experience from Madeleine because in her mind he is responsible for every wrong she has experienced since her arrival in town. 

Finally we turn to Madeleine. He immediately takes up the case of Fantine, and is completely undeterred by her response to him. On the contrary in fact, when he hears her situation he is heartbroken for her and asks her why she did not bring her case to him earlier. His behavior is revealing the reality of just how warped Fantine's view of things had become. Additionally, Madeleine and Javert are forced to confront one another here. We already know that Javert views Madeleine as a wolf in sheeps clothing but must tread carefully because of Madeleine's position. Here we see Madeleine confronted with the twisted and upside-down notion of justice that Javert carries. After several back and forth moves Madeleine makes it clear that javert has no say and must accept that Fantine will go free. 

This brings us to the end result for Fantine. Madeleine will pay all of her debts, ensure she never lacks again, and will take steps to bring Cosette to her immediately. He also points out that nothing she has done is evil, and without saying it, we still know he is thinking of his own crimes driven by need. 

This whole chapter masterfully puts Madeleine in a position where he is able to echo the grace shown him by Myriel. Simultaneously, it once again puts that in stark contrast with Javert and his response to the same reality of finding himself outside society. Now he has not only seen Madeleine moved back inside society - something he thought impossible - but is also seeing Madeleine actively pulling others in before his very eyes. 

It seems right that the next "book" we encounter is titled Javert, because there is a lot of interesting material to be uncovered with Javert and his posture toward himself, society, and the people he finds himself surrounded by. I'm looking forward to seeing where Hugo takes us next!
