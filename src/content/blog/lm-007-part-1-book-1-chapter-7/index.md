In this chapter we see a potential conflict arise between M. Myriel's ethic and philosophy of ministry and the real world challenges beyond his control. We find out that there is a band of brigands led by a man named Cravatte that are terrorizing some of the mountain passes and Myriel needs to travel into that area to visit a small commune of shepherds in that region. Initially he is being strongly advised not to go, but he persists in his insistence that he goes knowing God will keep him safe and that he has nothing that thieves would want to steal. 

He goes alone with no guards, just a small local boy serving as a guide. He fairs well and is able to spend a fortnight with the commune without any interference from Cravatte and his gang. He wants to hold a ceremonial Te Deum but the locale curé is concerned because they don't have any of the proper accouterments. Myriel insists that God will provide and they press on. Sure enough a large chest arrives with a note in it from Cravatte - he has returned the treasures he stole from the cathedral at Embrun. 

Commenting on the whole situation Myriel says "Was I not right? The poor priest went empty-handed to the poor people of the hills and comes back with his hands full. I set out with nothing but my trust in God and I have brought back the riches of a cathedral."

His simple faith and commitment to caring for the needs of those who would be easiest to push aside is exemplary. It's the embodiment of what James calls "pure and undefiled religion" in his epistle, and it's a strong contrast to what was probably the norm in France at this time (and what we tend to see in large swaths of the church today).
