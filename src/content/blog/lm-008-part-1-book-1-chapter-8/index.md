In this chapter the senator is dining with Myriel and has had a good bit of wine already when he decides to pontificate on his own philosophy of a very self-centered form of epicureanism with a good bit of nihilism thrown in. After disparaging religion as something for the weak and poor the senator gives space for the Bishop to respond. 

I love that the Bishop doesn't take the bait. Instead he just gently points out that the senators philosophy is one that would be completely impossible and untenable apart from the great amount of privilege he has. Rather than trying to debate rationally, or argue for the superiority of his own beliefs, the Bishop uncovers the motivation and grounding of the senator and shows them to be base and empty. He does so in a gentle way though, without actually confronting them directly. Rather than a fight he gently leaves the senator with some questions to think over, something we could all learn from in an age of online discourse where changing minds is nearly impossible.
