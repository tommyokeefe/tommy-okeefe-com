This chapter details the beginning of Jean Valjean's encounter with Myriel and it is beautiful. I won't attempt to summarize it because it is fairly short and deserves to be read in full. What I want to talk about is the way that Myriel uses humanizing and dignifying and language when addressing Valjean and the impact that seems to have on Valjean. 

In a state of desperation Valjean decides to get things out on the table immediately and presents his yellow ticket showing he is a felon on parole. He gives the details as well - he served 19 years, 5 I believe for a violent robbery and 14 more for repeated attempts of escape. Valjean has put his darkest truths on the table and he expects to be rejected as before. Called a dog, driven away, demeaned as a brigand and a danger. This is not the response he gets. Myriel bids him to sit and warm himself. He lets him know he can eat with them, and they don't need payment. He repeatedly calls him Monsieur, addressing him in a way that centers who he is rather than what he has done. Then Myriel takes this a step further as Valjean is somewhat undone by this unexpected kindess, warmth and welcome. Myriel refers to Valjean as his brother. 

Here it isn't thief, brigand, vagabond, or any other word that would have centered what Valjean had done. Instead it was a word that reminded Valjean that he was a child of God, and as such, he was Myriel's brother. 

Many human relationships occupy a tension where the desire is to be fully known and fully loved, but the overriding fear is that if we are truly known we will be rejected completely and find ourselves unloved. As a result many people are hesitant to reveal themselves or become vulnerable, even when they have found love, because of a combination of past experiences and often a view that they are in fact unlovable or undeserving of love. 

Valjean has tried to hide who he was but it keeps slipping out. Not only is he unloved, but he receives full rejection, bordering on hate. He is made out to be a monster, something that should be feared, and it is tormenting him. When he throws his truth before Myriel he expects the same response, but Myriel takes reality and reframes things. Valjean is not a monster, he is a man, just as deserving as anyone else who may come to this place. Valjean is not a terror, he is a brother, a child of God worthy of love. 

Love is an incredibly powerful thing, and when it is embodied and enacted through forgiveness it can transfrom everything.
