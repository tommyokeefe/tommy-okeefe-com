All that we have seen of Digne so far has come as color at the edges of the portrait Hugo has painted us of the good bishop Myriel, so it comes as quite a shock when through the eyes of a stranger in desperate need the Digne we find is one full of suspicion, closed doors and deep fear. 

This "Outcast" according to the book title is one whose appearance is described for us but initially he is given no name, and no history. He is a traveler (not known to any in Digne) who appears to be passing through in need of room for the night. We see him make a stop at the town hall, then head on to the finest inn in Digne. Here a strange occurrence happens. When the innkeeper sees him, he is initially worried about the stranger's ability to pay, but upon showing his purse that seems to be settled. After the innkeeper sends a note with the scullery boy to the town hall. When the boy returns with a new note, the innkeeper reads it and his demeanor changes. He has learned something of the man but we don't know exactly what it is. Through a protracted series of interactions it is made clear that our outcast will find no meal or bed here - not even a spot in the stables. After some back and forth the innkeeper reveals that he has learned this man's identity (and some things about him that are still unknown to us) and the man is no longer welcome at the inn. This man's name is Jean Valjean. 

Though we don't know specifics about Valjean at this point, word has spread throughout the town about who he is and seemingly what he has done, and he cannot find welcome anywhere. Inns are closed to him. Homes reject him. The prison won't have him unless he gets arrested. Even a doghouse turns out to be inhospitable. Children throw stones at him and eventually he goes beyond the town and into the twilight and looming darkness beyond the town. During his desperate search for shelter we learn a bit more about Jean Valjean. He is a marauder and a brigand. A bandit of some sort who has been released from prison. Digne seems to have no room for a man like him. 

After a bit of a scare beyond the town Valjean comes back to Digne and finds a bench to sleep on. On the way to that bench he passed the church and shook his fist. There is clearly a history that we can assume will later be revealed. An older woman finds him and begins a conversation and an angry and tired Valjean is resistant to engaging. He lets slip that he slept on a wooden mattress for nineteen years so sleeping on stone now is not a problem. He says he was a soldier but the vibes say maybe this wooden mattress was something found in a prison cell. The woman points him to a small humble abode next to what appears to be the bishops mansion, and we know that small home is in fact the home of the good bishop Myriel. The woman urges Valjean to knock on that door and our chapter ends. 

A bit of introspection seems apt here. Are we more likely to extend help to people like ourselves and avoid those who are truly desperate out of fear of the difference? Are their limits to our love? What about the simple love and faith of Myriel? How will that respond? Are we like him, or the people of the village? 

Further, assuming we are correct that Valjean has just left prison, doesn't that mean he has served his time? Why does his punishment continue? Will he carry that shame forever? Is there any escaping our own past? The worst choices we have made - are they destined to haunt us forever? 

So many things to think about. Yet our story moves on.
