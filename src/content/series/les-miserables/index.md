This is a collection of all of my Les Miserables reflections as I read through the book at the pace of a chapter a day. Reading the novel should take exactly one year and I started on January 1st 2026. Since the structure reflects the layout of the novel, finding a post for a specific chapter should be relatively straight forward.
